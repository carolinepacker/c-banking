# Overview

This project is a simple banking system made in C++. It has the ability to add accounts, withdraw, deposit, and display account information.

My purpose for writing this software was to increase my knowledge in the basics of C++. I haven't worked with C++ very much, so it was interesting to learn about classes and the detailed nature of C++.

# Future Work

* Adding a feature to delete a client's acccount
